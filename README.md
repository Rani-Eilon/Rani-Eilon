# Welcome to My Portfolio

Hi! I'm Rani, and here are some of the exciting projects I've worked on.

## Projects

### Shoe Pair Classifier
**Description**:  
This project is focused on building a machine learning model that classifies pairs of shoes based on images. The classifier detects if two shoes in an image form a matching pair.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), OpenCV.
- **Challenges Overcome**: Tackled challenges such as background noise and varying shoe angles.

### AI-Driven Shape
**Description**:  
An AI-driven project that generates and analyzes different geometric shapes, optimizing for various parameters such as symmetry, size, and proportion.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, AI/ML algorithms, Shape Optimization.
- **Challenges Overcome**: Overcame issues with shape complexity and real-time processing.
