## My Name is Rani, and here are some of the projects I’ve worked on and enjoyed building.

## Asynchronous FIFO (SystemVerilog + RTL Verification)

This project implements a complete asynchronous FIFO using SystemVerilog. The design includes Gray-code pointer logic, two-flip-flop synchronizers for safe clock-domain crossing, and accurate full/empty detection. I also built a clear and organized verification environment and used ModelSim to simulate and verify the behavior of the FIFO under different operating conditions. The project structure and coding style follow common industry conventions.

## Shoe Pair Classifier

A computer vision project that builds a neural network to determine whether two shoes in an image form a matching pair. The system uses CNN architectures together with OpenCV preprocessing to classify images and evaluate pairing accuracy.

## AI-Driven Shape Analysis

An AI-based tool that generates and analyzes geometric shapes. The project explores symmetry, spatial structure, and shape optimization using machine-learning techniques./n
